# DodgerBoy- C# Visual-Studio2013
This game helps refresh your brain. It is called DodgerBoy simply because you dodge the zombies in order to collect money bags. Each bag you collect earns you atleast $5 which is equivalent to the games score. Once you get hit by a zombie, you die and game is over. The game uses an online score-board which displays the five Best Scores. The online score-board can be viewed from this [link](http://dreamlo.com/lb/4MyOWbyZg0a8srM8OyV2HwrLX57zl5uUOpoWWgyFt6qw). 
The game was developed using Unity game engine 5.2.1f1 and ported over to Windows Store - running on Ms Visual Studio 2013.
